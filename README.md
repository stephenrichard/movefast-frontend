# front-end

## Comments

[Sandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/front-end-mf-k5w3k)

I chose to use Vue because I have been working with Vue and Nuxt since last May (after working with React for almost 3 years) for a freelance client.

CSS grid is used for great flexibility combined with order property.

The shuffle function is taken from https://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976/2882643 with the use of a new array to avoid mutating the existing state directly.
